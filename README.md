# Tips Dataset Dashboard

This is a dashboard built using Python, Dash, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore and visualize the "tips" dataset. The dashboard allows you to interactively analyze different aspects of the dataset, such as the relationship between total bill amount and tip amount, comparison of tip amounts based on various filters, and more.

## Features

- Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between total bill amount and tip amount. You can filter the data points based on selected days of the week.

- Pie Chart: Compares the number of smokers and non-smokers in the dataset. You can filter the chart based on lunch or dinner time.

- Size vs. Tip Amount Comparison: Displays a bar chart comparing the tip amounts based on the group size. You can choose between male and female to update the chart.

- Filtered Scatter Plot: Shows a scatter plot similar to the first section but with additional filtering options. You can select a range of total bill amounts and filter by lunch or dinner time.
